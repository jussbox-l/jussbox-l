## 💡 Philosophy

> I learn by building and documenting. My goal is to break things, fix them, and leave behind clear notes so future-me (and others) can replicate it.

## 🎲 Fun Fact

When I’m not tinkering with servers, I enjoy diving into anime/manga, experimenting with game ideas, and constantly reorganizing my homelab setups.
